# Starter Code

- Implement a Singly Linked List data structure by completing the skeleton code provided in the file sll.py. Once completed, your implementation will include the following methods:

  > insert_front()
  > insert_back()
  > insert_at_index()
  > remove_at_index()
  > remove()
  > count()
  > find()
  > slice()

- The number of objects stored in the list at any given time will be between 0 and 900 inclusive.
- The variable in the LinkedList class (\_head) is marked as private, so it may only be accessed/changed directly inside the class. Variables in the SLNode class (provided in its own file, as it will also be used in Parts 4 and 5) are not marked as private. You are allowed to access/change their values directly wherever the SLNode class is used, and are not required to write getter or setter methods for them.
- You are not allowed to use ANY built-in Python data structures or their methods. Your solutions should not call double underscore (“dunder”) methods.
- This implementation must be done with the use of a front sentinel node.
